## Specialized Prompt Variations

### 1. **Aggregation Results Prompt**
```
You're explaining aggregated data results. Focus on:

AGGREGATION CONTEXT:
- What was being measured or counted
- The grouping criteria used
- Time periods or categories involved
- Comparison points (vs. previous period, average, etc.)

EXPLANATION APPROACH:
- Lead with the highest/lowest values
- Explain the distribution or spread
- Identify patterns or trends
- Translate percentages into real-world meaning

Example Response Style:
"The sales data shows that [highest performing category] generated $X in revenue, representing Y% of total sales. In contrast, [lowest category] only contributed Z%, suggesting [business insight]."
```

### 2. **Trend Analysis Results Prompt**
```
You're explaining time-series or trend data. Focus on:

TREND CONTEXT:
- Direction of change (increasing, decreasing, stable)
- Rate of change (gradual, rapid, accelerating)
- Seasonal patterns or cyclical behavior
- Significant inflection points

EXPLANATION APPROACH:
- Start with overall trend direction
- Quantify the change with specific numbers
- Identify peak and trough periods
- Compare different segments or categories
- Explain potential causes for observed patterns

Example Response Style:
"Over the past [time period], [metric] has [increased/decreased] by X%, with the most significant growth occurring in [specific period]. This represents a [description] from the previous [comparison period]."
```

### 3. **Comparison Results Prompt**
```
You're explaining comparative data (rankings, benchmarks, A/B tests). Focus on:

COMPARISON CONTEXT:
- What entities are being compared
- The basis for comparison (metric, time period, etc.)
- Relative performance differences
- Statistical significance if applicable

EXPLANATION APPROACH:
- Rank items from best to worst performance
- Quantify differences between top and bottom performers
- Express comparisons in relative terms (X times larger, Y% better)
- Highlight surprising or unexpected results

Example Response Style:
"[Top performer] leads with [metric value], which is X% higher than [second place] and Y times better than [lowest performer]. The gap between [comparison points] suggests [business insight]."
```

## Sample Implementation

### **Complete Prompt Example:**
```
You are explaining SQL query results about customer purchasing behavior to marketing managers.

ORIGINAL QUERY: 
SELECT customer_segment, COUNT(*) as customers, AVG(total_spent) as avg_spending, 
       SUM(total_spent) as revenue FROM customer_analysis GROUP BY customer_segment

RESULTS:
- Premium: 245 customers, $1,247 average spending, $305,515 total revenue
- Standard: 1,832 customers, $387 average spending, $708,984 total revenue  
- Budget: 3,421 customers, $127 average spending, $434,467 total revenue

BUSINESS CONTEXT: E-commerce company analyzing customer value segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

Please explain these results in natural language that marketing managers can easily understand and act upon.

RESPONSE:
## Summary
Our customer base consists of three distinct spending segments, with Standard customers generating the highest total revenue despite Premium customers spending significantly more per person.

## Key Findings
- **Standard customers drive the most revenue**: 1,832 Standard customers contributed $709K (48% of total revenue), making them our most valuable segment overall
- **Premium customers are high-value but small**: Only 245 Premium customers, but each spends $1,247 on average - over 3x more than Standard customers
- **Budget segment is large but low-value**: 3,421 Budget customers represent 62% of our customer base but contribute only 30% of revenue at $127 per customer

## Details
The data reveals a classic customer value pyramid. While Premium customers make up less than 5% of our customer base, their individual spending power is substantial. The Standard segment offers the best balance of size and spending, while the Budget segment represents a large volume opportunity with lower individual value.

## Implications
Focus marketing investment on retaining and growing the Standard segment while developing strategies to either upgrade Budget customers or acquire more Premium customers. The concentration of revenue in the Standard segment suggests this group should be the primary target for loyalty programs and personalized campaigns.
```

## Key Success Factors

1. **Always start with the business question** the query was trying to answer
2. **Translate technical terms** into business language
3. **Provide context and comparisons** to make numbers meaningful
4. **Include actionable insights** relevant to the audience
5. **Structure information logically** from summary to details
6. **Use appropriate precision** - avoid overwhelming with unnecessary decimals
7. **Highlight the most important findings** prominently

This approach transforms raw SQL results into clear, actionable business intelligence that drives decision-making.
